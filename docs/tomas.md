# Tomas's shitty ideas

This is just a random collections of ideas and technologies I'd like to play
with at some point. Some of them are a bit over the top, but we can use these
documents as a backlog.

## General

- A two-dimensional game in a sci-fi setting.
  - Two-dimensional, because I don't know shit about computer graphics and
    don't want to set up a gigantic 3D engine.
  - It's easier to get graphical assets when working in 2D, because you don't
    have to learn 3D modeling.
  - We can go crazy with explosions.
- A shoot 'em up game like Jets 'n' Guns?
- Shoot 'em up games can be either side-scrolling (like Jets 'n' Guns) or
  vertically scrolling (more common).
  - I actually like the side-scrollers more. Could benefit from [parallax
    scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling).

## Technology

- Let's include some randomly generated assets. These could be:
  - [Spaceships](https://2draw.me/random_ship_generator/index.en.htm) (see the
    sources in the About section for JS and Python codes and some more demos).
  - [Names](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/spaceship-names.php)
  - Weapon effects - randomly generate a projectile shape, size and color.
  - Entire levels? This might be stretching it, but we could generate
    obstacles, rewards and enemies while a level is loading.
- While we talked about the [Love 2D](https://love2d.org/) engine before, we
  can implement it in anything else, really. The whole thing could be
  browser-based and written in JS, a Python project in
  [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news), etc.
- I'd like to play around with some networking later, multiplayer over LAN?
